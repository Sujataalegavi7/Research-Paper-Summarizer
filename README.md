Our task was to summarize research papers using analytical and empirical methods, both extractive and abstractive respectively and we have tried to measure performances of both the tasks. We mined research papers under the topic of Computer Science from the ScienceDirect website using the method provided in the research paper “A Supervised Approach to Extractive Summarisation of Scientific Papers”[1].Although our models did not perform well, more training time and computational power would definitely improve it. Also, we weren’t able to implement transformers, as that required more computation and time. The future scope of our project would be to implement BERT.
